Importa Notices for Mark: 
    So whenever I am using any content from external source I am reading license information:
        For fontawsome I think we can use free icons for comercial use no requiremnts to accredit maker
        For Google Fonts we can freely use them no need to accredit.
        For dm flat icon {these are used in footers / and I am using them because they are used in old site} I have uploaded license
            I think dm flat icons are required to accredied and we can do that in documenation to be at safe side but I have copied 
            license for you to look at it.
    
    The plain image that I am using to create carousel transparent effect has been taken from google search I still have to look for its license
